No PPI and tried to not take famotidine just gaviscon. Did not work. Was in and out until 2am, at which point I had a lot of acid and took famotidine. Then I slept. 
07/10/25
Took PPI first thing in the morning with my shake and magnesium at night. One of the best sleep I’ve gotten. It was also cool in the room.
07/09/25
Didn’t take PPI took Famotidine. Didn’t have GERD yet I had insomnia the whole night and couldn’t sleep at all. 
General info
Gerd triggers - caffeine, some alcohol like red wine, really fat meals with cheese, eating after 8pm, dark chocolate

OpenEvidence answer to PPI vs surgery for me:
In summary, for a young adult with moderate, PPI-responsive GERD and normal esophageal manometry, chronic PPI therapy at the lowest effective dose is the preferred first-line management, as supported by the American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.[1][6][7-8][10] Anti-reflux surgery and minimally invasive alternatives may be considered in select patients after thorough counseling and shared decision-making, but are not routinely indicated in patients with well-controlled, moderate GERD. The patient should be reassured regarding the safety and efficacy of long-term PPI therapy, with ongoing education and periodic reassessment to ensure optimal management and quality of life.

Below notes from 2024
Gerd - first consistent Google searches started in 10/22
I went to the doctor first on August 2023
Endoscopy on 10/2023 - some inflammation but nothing major. Diagnosed me with Gerd and gastritis 
Switched doctors.
Started with Dr. Daher on 02/2024 - Prescribed famotidine
Took famotidine for two weeks, but the symptoms were so bad that I asked to switch to a PPI. Acid reflux, indigestion, globus. Started omeprazole in 04/2024 and took it for 1.5 months. Helped tremendously but I had occasional migraines. 
Switched over to pantoprazole beginning of July 2024. 20mg. Look mood, some nausea, but relatively no symptoms so far. Some small headaches when I’m coming off.

ENDOSCOPIST: Shervin Shafa MD STATUS: outpatient
ASSISTING PHYSICIAN:
INDICATIONS: The patient is a 32 yr old male here for an EGD due to GERD and
epigastric abdominal burning/pain
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: EGD with biopsy
EGD with Bravo capsule
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None
MEDICATIONS: Per Anesthesia Record.
CONSENT: The patient understands the risks and benefits of the procedure and
understands that these risks include, but are not limited to: sedation,
allergic reaction, infection, perforation and/or bleeding. Alternative means of
evaluation and treatment include, among others: physical exam, x-rays, and/or
surgical intervention. The patient elects to proceed with this endoscopic
procedure.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
During the intra-op preparation period, all mechanical & medical equipment was
checked for proper function. Hand hygiene and appropriate measures for
infection prevention was taken. After the risks, benefits and alternatives of
the procedure were thoroughly explained, Informed consent was verified,
confirmed and timeout was successfully executed by the treatment team. The
patient was anesthetized and the EGD and EG29-I20C A0038A0618 endoscope was
introduced through the mouth and advanced to the second portion of the
duodenum. The desired location for placement of the Bravo PH capsule was

determined endoscopically. The Bravo PH capsule delivery system was placed
through the patient's mouth into the esophagus at the desired location. After
proper placement, vacuum was applied and locking pin activated. The delivery
system was then removed from the patient. The gastroscope was then slowly
withdrawn and removed.
ESOPHAGUS: The GE junction was regular and seen at 45cm. The area was also
visualized under optical enhancement. The esophagus to the SC junction
appeared normal without inflammation or mass. A Bravo esophageal pH monitor
was deployed successfully 34cm from the incisors. Placement was confirmed
endoscopically.
STOMACH: A 2 cm hiatal hernia was noted. The stomach otherwise appeared
normal. Multiple biopsies were performed using cold forceps. Tissue samples
were placed in jar A. Sample sent for histology.
DUODENUM: The duodenum appeared normal, including the mucosa of the duodenal
bulb and second portion.
ADVERSE EVENTS: There were no complications.
IMPRESSIONS: Normal GE junction and esophagus s/p Bravo capsule placement
Small hiatal hernia s/p biopsies
SPECIMENS: As above
ANTICOAGULATION MANAGEMENT: Recommendation:
RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Await biopsy results
2. Await Bravo study results
3. Follow up with the referring MD

Addendum by Shafa, MD, Shervin on December 09, 2024 11:13 EST
For total 48 hours duration of the study, the total esophageal acid exposure was 4.2%
(normal <4.9%) with majority in the upright position. The upright exposure was 7.4% (normal
<7.3) and supine was 0.3% (normal <1.4). The total DeMeester score was normal at 13.6.
There was positive symptom index with coughing symptoms.
Although, there was normal total esophageal acid exposure, there maybe a slight behavioral
component to patients symptoms given the predominant upright reflux episodes.

Normal median IRP and normal mean DCI. Peristalsis was largely preserved, although two
contractions revealed weak contraction vigor. Liquid bolus transit was mildly reduced at
70%. Overall, this was a normal manometry study.

Stomach
Mucosa Mucosa
Noal mucosa was noted in the whole esophagus. Two cold forceps blopsies were performed for hiatology.
Patchy discontinuous erythema and congestion of the mucosa with no bleeding was noled in the Antrum.
These findings are compatible with gastritis. Blopsy/Blopsies done and Blopsies also taken from normal Incisura to check for H. Pylori. Two cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology.
Other intorventione:
Impressions:
Normal mucosa in the whole esophagus. (Blopsy).
Erythema and congestion in the Antrum compatible with gastritis. (Blopsy),
